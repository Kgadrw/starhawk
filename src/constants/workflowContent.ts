    description: "The system enrolls farmers through agents or digital channels, capturing farm GPS, crop type, and size to issue an insurance policy. Drones and weather data create a baseline risk profile using AI. Farms are continuously monitored, and farmers receive early warnings for weather or crop stress. If damage occurs, farmers submit claims through USSD, app, or agents. AI automatically evaluates losses using remote sensing and weather data, giving payout recommendations. Insurers review and finalize decisions. Approved payouts are sent to farmers, and all claim actions are recorded. Government and insurers can access anonymized analytics for planning, risk assessment, and performance tracking."
